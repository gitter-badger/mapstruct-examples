This repository contains examples showing how to use [MapStruct](http://mapstruct.org/), a Java annotation processor for the generation of type-safe bean mapping classes.

Currently, the following examples exist:

* _mapstruct-on-gradle_: Shows how to use MapStruct in Gradle based projects; To build the example project, run `./gradlew clean build` on the command line
* _mapstruct-lombok_: Shows how to use MapStruct together with Lombok; To build the example project, run `mvn clean install` on the command line
* _mapstruct-iterable-non-iterable: Shows how by means of a mapper util class conversions can be made from an iterable- to its non-iterable element
